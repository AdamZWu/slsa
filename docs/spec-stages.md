Specifications go through various stages of development from which you
should have different expectations. This document defines these
different stages and their meaning.

Every specification should prominently display a *Status of this
document* section stating which stage the specification you are
looking at is in.

## Working Draft

This is the first stage of development a specification goes
through. At this point, not much should be expected of it. The
specification may be very incomplete and may change at any time and
even be abandoned. It is therefore not suitable for reference or for
implementation beyond experimentation.

A specification may be published several times during this stage as
work progresses. The status section of the document may provide
additional information as to its development status and whether
reviews and feedback are welcome.

## Proposed Specification

At this stage the document is considered to be feature complete and is
published as a way to invite final reviews. Editorial changes may
still be made but no addition of new features is expected and short of
problems being found no significant changes are expected to happen
anymore.

## Specification

At this stage the document is considered final and stable. It is
suitable for reference and implementation in production. Changes may
only happen if deemed necessary and will be avoided as much as
possible if they might adversely impact implementations.

## Retired

This stage indicates that the specification should no longer be
used. It has been either rendered obsolete by a newer version or
abandoned for some reason. The status of the document may provide
additional information and point to the new document to use intead if
there is one.
